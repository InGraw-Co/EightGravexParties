# EGP

**EGP** is a first-person survival horror game where the player remains in a single room and observes the environment using cameras, lights, and basic control systems.  
The goal is to survive consecutive nights by carefully monitoring threats and managing limited resources wisely.

The game focuses on tension, observation, and decision-making rather than fast action, creating constant pressure and uncertainty during gameplay.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This game was created by **InGraw 24 Co.**, and its owner and main developer is **Mateusz Lademann**.  
All rights to this production are reserved. Copying, distributing, or modifying the game without the author’s permission is strictly prohibited.

The entire game source code was developed **100% originally** using **Unreal Engine 5.4**.  
All visual assets were created using **Adobe Substance Painter** or directly inside the engine.  
All 3D models were designed from scratch in **Blender**.

It should be noted that **two models were initially generated using artificial intelligence**, but they were heavily modified and reworked. As a result, they serve only as inspiration for the final in-game versions.

Any assets sourced externally (materials, textures, models, sounds, etc.) were obtained under valid licenses that allow **commercial use**.

Thank you for your interest in our project — we hope you enjoy the experience.
